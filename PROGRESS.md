## Current Phase

**Phase 4 — HUD** (not started)

---

## What's Done

- [x] CLAUDE.md created — auto-loads project context each session
- [x] PLAN.md created — full implementation plan with all design decisions resolved
- [x] Project scaffolded — Vite + TypeScript + Three.js
- [x] Dungeon renderer — builds wall/floor/ceiling geometry from a 2D map array
- [x] Two-room map with connecting corridor
- [x] Grid movement — forward, back, strafe left/right, turn left/right
- [x] Smooth tween camera on every step and turn
- [x] Torch point light with flicker, follows player
- [x] Fog for atmosphere
- [x] Tested and working in Windows browser via WSL2 (`npm run dev` → localhost:5173)
- [x] **Phase 1 complete** — Foundation Refactor:
  - Extracted `PlayerState` + grid logic into `src/grid.ts` (pure TS, no Three.js)
  - `DungeonLevel`, `Entity`, `CellOverride` types in `src/types.ts`
  - Grid format: `string[]` with char-based cells, `WALKABLE_CELLS` set
  - External JSON level loading with validation (`src/levelLoader.ts`)
  - 3 level files in `public/levels/`
  - `buildDungeon` returns `THREE.Group` (enables level teardown)
  - `main.ts` async init with error handling
  - Vitest: 38 tests (grid logic + loader validation)

---

- [x] **Phase 2 complete** — Visual Polish:
  - Procedural pixelart textures (9 styles: 4 wall, 3 floor, 2 ceiling)
  - Q/E key bindings for turning
  - 4-layer texture resolution: hard-coded → defaults → charDefs → areas
  - `CharDef` system — custom ASCII chars with solid/walkable + texture set
  - 6 dungeon levels (levels 4–6 use charDefs for visual theming)
  - `DUNGEON-DESIGNER.md` — full level JSON schema reference
  - 76 tests
  - Visual polish verified in-game

---

- [x] **Phase 3 complete** — Doors & Interaction:
  - `GameState` class — door state (open/closed/locked), key inventory, lever/plate logic
  - Door-aware walkability — `isDoorOpen` callback in `isWalkable()` and `PlayerState`
  - Interaction system — `interact()` via Space key: open/close/unlock doors, pull levers
  - Door visuals — 3D stone frames (pillars + lintel) with door panels, sliding animation on open/close
  - Mechanical doors (lever/plate-controlled) — can't be opened/closed by player interaction
  - Interactive doors have brass buttons on frame to visually distinguish them
  - `D` cells without door entity auto-create a closed, non-mechanical door
  - Key system — auto-pickup on step, `keyRenderer.ts` billboard meshes
  - Lever system — repeatable up/down state, stand on cell + face wall to pull, animated handle
  - Pressure plates — one-time use, visual pressed state (sinks + darkens), auto-trigger on step
  - Entity validation in `levelLoader.ts` — doors, keys, levers (incl. wall), pressure plates
  - Level 7 "The Locked Vault" — showcase level for all Phase 3 features
  - 167 tests (91 new)

## Session Log

### Session 0 — Project conceived
- Decided on genre, tech stack, and approach via conversation with Claude (claude.ai)
- Core design pillars established — see DESIGN.md
- No code written, ready to start scaffolding

### Session 1 — Scaffold
- Created CLAUDE.md for persistent session context
- Finalised remaining open decisions: TypeScript, Vite + npm, tween camera
- Scaffolded full project: `index.html`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/main.ts`, `src/dungeon.ts`, `src/player.ts`, `.gitignore`
- Two rooms connected by a corridor, grid movement with tween camera, torch flicker, fog
- Tested successfully in browser

### Session 4 — Phase 1 Complete
- Completed all remaining Phase 1 steps (2–5) in one session
- Defined `DungeonLevel` type, switched grid from `number[][]` to `string[]`
- Built `levelLoader.ts` with `loadLevel()` + `validateLevel()` — fetch + validate JSON levels
- Created 3 level files in `public/levels/`
- `buildDungeon` returns `THREE.Group` instead of mutating scene
- Wrapped `main.ts` in async `init()` with error handling
- Added Vitest — 38 tests across grid logic and loader validation
- Ran Developer Council code review (SoftwareDeveloper + QaTester)
- Addressed all council findings: validation hardening, test coverage gaps, minor fixes

### Session 3 — Phase 1 Step 1: Extract PlayerState
- Extracted pure grid logic (`Facing`, direction tables, `isWalkable`, `PlayerState`) into `src/grid.ts`
- Refactored `src/player.ts` to delegate to `PlayerState`, keeping only Three.js rendering
- TypeScript compiles clean, no Three.js dependency in grid.ts

### Session 7 — Phase 2: charDefs texture system + designer guide
- Replaced verbose cellOverrides with 4-layer texture resolution: hard-coded → defaults → charDefs → areas
- Added `CharDef` interface (extends TextureSet with char + solid) to types.ts
- `buildWalkableSet()` in grid.ts merges walkable charDef chars into WALKABLE_CELLS
- `isWalkable()` and `PlayerState` accept optional walkable set for custom chars
- `buildDungeon()` resolves charDef textures (layer 3) and solid charDef wall textures for neighbor faces
- Level loader validates charDefs before grid chars, extends known/walkable sets
- Rewrote levels 4–6 JSON: replaced areas with charDefs, grids now use b/,/m/w characters
- Created `DUNGEON-DESIGNER.md` — full level JSON schema reference
- 76 tests pass (28 new), TypeScript compiles clean

### Session 6 — Phase 2: Texture variety + new dungeons
- Added 6 new procedural texture generators: brick/mossy/wood walls, dirt/cobblestone floors, wooden beams ceiling
- Built texture registry with cached getters (`getWallTexture`, `getFloorTexture`, `getCeilingTexture`)
- Created `src/textureNames.ts` — pure constants file with type-safe texture name validation
- Wired `CellOverride` into `buildDungeon` — per-cell material selection via override lookup map
- Added `ceilingTexture` field to `CellOverride` type
- Level loader validates cellOverrides (bounds, known texture names, types) — 10 new tests
- Created 3 new themed levels: level4 (Sunken Crypt), level5 (Winding Depths), level6 (Grand Hall)
- Identified need to refactor cellOverrides model — current per-cell approach is too verbose for larger maps

### Session 10 — Door system improvements + lever/plate polish
- 3D door frames — stone pillars + lintel (always visible), door panel slides up/down via `DoorAnimator`
- `D` cells without entity auto-create closed doors (no more empty doorways)
- Doors re-closable with Space (non-mechanical only)
- Mechanical flag — doors targeted by levers/plates can't be opened/closed by player
- Interactive doors have brass buttons on frame to distinguish from mechanical
- Lever: repeatable up/down state with animated handle (`LeverAnimator`), directional wall interaction
- Pressure plate: one-time use, pressed state sinks mesh + darker cracked texture
- Door animation speed increased (3.0 → 5.0 units/sec)
- `openDoor()` rejects mechanical doors; `activatePressurePlate` bypasses check
- Entity validation for lever `wall` field
- 167 tests (20 new), TypeScript compiles clean

### Session 9 — Phase 3 Complete: Test level + entity validation (Step 7)
- Created `public/levels/level7.json` "The Locked Vault" — showcase level with all Phase 3 features
- Added entity validation to `levelLoader.ts` — validates doors, keys, levers, pressure plates
- 15 new entity validation tests in `levelLoader.test.ts`
- Updated `main.ts` to load level7 by default
- 147 tests total, TypeScript compiles clean
- Phase 3 complete

### Session 8 — Phase 3: Doors & Interaction (Steps 1–6)
- Created `gameState.ts` — doors (open/closed/locked), keys, levers, pressure plates, inventory
- Added `isDoorOpen` callback to `isWalkable()` and `PlayerState` for door-aware movement
- Created `interaction.ts` — Space key opens doors, unlocks with keys, pulls levers
- Created `doorRenderer.ts` — door meshes with auto-orientation, visibility toggle
- Added procedural door textures (wood + locked iron-banded) to `textures.ts`
- Created `keyRenderer.ts` — gold key billboard meshes, auto-pickup on step
- Levers toggle linked doors, pressure plates one-way open linked doors
- `Player` gained `getState()`, `setOnMove()` callback for step-triggered events
- 132 tests (56 new across gameState, interaction, grid)

### Session 2 — Planning
- Ran Developer Council (4 specialists, 3 rounds) to identify all vague spots and create implementation plan
- Resolved all underspecified design decisions (stats, doors, inventory, enemies, resources, transitions)
- Created PLAN.md with 8-phase build order, architecture plan, and file structure
- Established session workflow rules in CLAUDE.md
- Updated PROGRESS.md to track phases

## Ideas Parking Lot

- Procedural dungeon generation (post v1)
- Ambient sound — dripping water, distant echoes
- Secret walls that push open
- Day/night cycle for outdoor sections
